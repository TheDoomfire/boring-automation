# Boring Automation

Automation for unzipping files, sorting, finding files for download, backup and more.

The point is whenever I have something I want to automate I can come here to do it.


## Installations

Create a venv `python -m venv .venv` //Name the folder whatever you want.

Activate it - Win: `source .venv/Scripts/activate` <!--  Mac: `source .venv/bin/activate` -->

### Requirements

`pip freeze > requirements.txt` - Create the requirements.txt
`pip install -r requirements.txt` - Installs it.
